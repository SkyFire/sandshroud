/* Crow: Quick example of what I want to see.
We have here a void, but we would use the following structure:
type: void name: Setup%s Pointer: (ScriptMgr * mgr); Comment: // Set up for %s
Type should always be void, %s is set to the name we want, and the comment should explain what the name cannot.

Example 1:
void SetupGenericCreatureScripts(ScriptMgr * mgr); // Set up for generic scripts.
Example 2:
/_* Set up for generic scripts. *_/_
void SetupGenericCreatureScripts(ScriptMgr * mgr);
Adhere or die.
