The way accounts are loaded has changed in Hearthstone. 
You'll notice a new `changed` field in the accounts DB.

When the loginserver starts up, it will load ALL accounts.
From that point on, it will only reload accounts that have CHANGED = 1.
So, when you insert/modify any data in accounts, set changed = 1 with it. 
This reduces logonserver overhead, so you can reload the DB more often.

If you wish to delete an account from the DB, set changed = 2.
