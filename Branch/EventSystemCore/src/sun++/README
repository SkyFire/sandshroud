How to install Sun++ scripts:

1) Make sure to compile the LATEST Hearthstone trnuk revision. Leave a copy of the
compiled emulator in the Hearthstone/bin/release folder. The scripts will need
these files to compile.

2) Create a directory called SunScripts or Sun++ inside your Hearthstone/src folder. 

3) Check out this folder (https://svn.assembla.com/svn/sunplusplus/Trunk) into the 
newly created SunScripts folder.

Windows:
4) Now open up one of the Visual Studio solutions and set the build configuration
to Release. Then compile. All the scripts should compile properly.

Linux:
4) Open Hearthstone\src\makefile.am and replace "scripts" with "SunScripts", like this:
SUBDIRS = Hearthstone-shared Hearthstone-logonserver Hearthstone-world Hearthstone-voicechat Hearthstone-realmserver SunScripts
Then compile.

5) Apply sql\hearthstone_sunplusplus_full.sql and sql\hearthstone_illidan_stormrage_encounter.sql to your world database.


Note1: C++ "scripts" can *NOT* be hot swapped, meaning you must restart the server
to use them.
Note2: We are only supporting the same rev as hearthstone officially does, so, we're currently at 3.0.9
