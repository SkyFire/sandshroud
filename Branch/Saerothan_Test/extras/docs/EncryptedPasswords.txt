Encrypted Passwords will drastically improve the security of your Hearthstone installation. In the event your database is compromised, the passwords in the login database will be in a format that is near-impossible to compromise. 

In order to convert your existing passwords to SHA1, try this query:
UPDATE accounts SET password = SHA1(  CONCAT(UPPER(login), ':', UPPER(password)));

The same concept applies for integrating your website with a database that uses encrypted passwords.
Take the username and password that the user submits to you through the web interface, and sha1 it with the formula above. Then simply compare the two sha1 hashes: the one in the database, and the one you have now generated. If they match, the login is valid!
