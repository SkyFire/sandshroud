Crow:
Its a basic map extractor.

Needed in directory:
Grid Maps(Run adgrid.exe inside your wow directory)
Vmaps
A mmaps folder.

Please note that it works, but only with the above things. It takes a long time to make mmaps.
In revision 350, compile was sort of disabled for the MMap extractor.
Please use the precompiled version.
